# Implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
This project focused on using both machine learning and deep learning technique which create images of pegasus using the combination of both horse and airplane image classes. The report of the project can be viewed here: https://github.com/fahimaqil/pegasusdcgan/blob/master/report/bpxd72.pdf

## Tools
1. The project used PyTorch as the main framework for machine learning.
2. We used Jupiter Notebook to create the documentation for the code. 
3. CIFAR-10 datasets were used to acquire the images of both horses and airplanes
4. Google Colab was the main machine to conduct the project
